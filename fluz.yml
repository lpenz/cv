aboutme: |
  **12+ years** of developing and working in projects led me to have hands-on experience solving **complex problems** in software development using several languages and frameworks across a wide range of companies, including startups, oil and gas industries, educational institutions and research labs. Driven **self-starter** and **fast learner**, always supporting my development teams with **top-notch coding skills**. In my last project, **I led** a pilot project to migrate around **400 test cases** with a constraints of **10 weeks** with **100% accomplished**.

  12+ years of developing and working in projects led me to have hands-on experience solving complex problems in software development using several languages and frameworks across a wide range of companies, including startups, oil and gas industries, educational institutions and research labs. Driven self-starter and fast learner, always supporting my development teams with top-notch coding skills. In my last project I lead a pilot project to migrate around 400 test cases with a constraints of 10 weeks with 100% achievement.

aboutme_bkp: |
  I am a developer with a Ph.D. in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and with over 10 years of experience in **C++/C** developing numerical models and simulators.

  All these years that I have been working in development led me to have hands-on experience solving complex problems in software development using several languages and software such as C++/C in numerical simulations, MongoDB to use for persistent memory for applications, Python to integrate different software, C# and Unity 3D to provide a immersive simulation environment, CMake/CDash to provide a cross-compile environment and test the code at the repository and Bash tools to automate the tasks in the Linux.

  As a team leader, what most motivated me was the challenge to maintain team cooperation to reach objectives in the process development. I have the experience to implement a Scrum/Kanban methodology, to share my knowledge with my colleagues and I believe programming requires writing skills so I do my best to write clear and good code and follow best practices.

  I was one of the founders in the Meetup group in Altran PT, and currently I am coordinator of Meetup sessions.

professional:
  - company: Altran Portugal [ASML Project]
    position: Senior Software Engineer
    period: 2018 - Present
    description: |
      Responsible to start the **ASML** project, where I contributed in **Variant Pattern** implementation at the robot component to be used in next lithography machine generation (EXE-5000), and currently I'm leading the Portugal team to expand unit tests quality using a framework based on **gtest**.

    achievements:
      - item: Delivered first version for RYUN (Universal Pick and Place Robot) component, with **all features planned** for this version;
      - item: Added unit tests for RYUN component with **100% of code coverage**;
      - item: Contributed with the RYAU component **migration** to legacy version;
      - item: Generated an investigation for RYAU autotesters, where I found **65% fake tests** (tests without implementation);
      - item: Achieved with success the first phase for UTTK to ATTEST migration **(~400 tests in 10 weeks)**.

  - company: Technomar Engineering
    position: IT Manager
    period: 2016 - 2018
    description: |  
      **Managed** the team responsible to implement new features in the **TMS (Technomar Maritime Simulator)**. **TMS** is a vessel maneuver simulator used in training activities.
      **Launched** the certification planning for **TMS** simulator by [DNV GL agency](https://www.dnvgl.com/), and the **collaborated** in the the core of hydrodynamic numerical model applied in a "full bridge" simulator.
      **Cultivated** good practices in software development process, such as **Scrum/Kanban** board, **TDD**, **Git** adoption and **mentored** meeting sessions to promote the homogenization of the knowledge of the team.

    achievements:
      - item: Enhanced in communication channel using the phonon framework, with gains in **15% speedup** and improve the code maintainability;
      - item: Redesigned the database in MongoDB, with a **definition of a schema** to be use in DB, and implemented a unified access library to access the data;
      - item: Orchestrated the **full delivery** of new simulation station at Technomar office, providing a simulator with 360 degrees immersion.
      - item: Instituted **Gitlab** as tool to obtain code metrics, and manage the bugs, new features, backlog and milestone control for the team and the founders.
  - company: Numerical Offshore Tank
    position: Researcher / HPC Software Engineer
    period: 2008 - 2016
    description: |  
      My role in the TPN laboratory was to develop a set of applications with **High-Performance Computing**. The languages I use was **C++/C**, **Python**, **MPI/sockets** and **bash** in Linux and Windows environment. Other duties includes testing and validation of numerical simulations, optimization, implementation of parallel improvements and integration with other projects.
      I also worked in others several projects, including the first version of **vessel maneuver simulator** called **SMH**. This project was select as finalist of **ANP (National Petroleum Agency)** [Prize Award for Technological Innovation in 2016](http://www.anp.gov.br/pesquisa-desenvolvimento-inovacao/302-premio-anp-de-inovacao-tecnologica/edicoes-anteriores/888-premio-anp-de-inovacao-tecnologica-2016).

    achievements:
      - item: Optimized parallel execution of the numerical solver in the cluster environment saving around **35% in resources** using my Ph.D. research;
      - item: Minimized around **10% the time execution** in the standalone version of the numerical solver using OpenMP;
      - item: Reduced in order to **60% the storage space** with the output results of the application using a binary format;
      - item: Championed and implemented a **cross compilation** in Windows and Linux environment with CMake;
      - item: Introduced a **MPI communication** instead pure socket, providing more robustness in the communication channel;
      - item: Championed the use of *tests in development* flow to increase the development quality;
      - item: Built an initial **CI** with (CDash and CTest) to check the repository integrity.
