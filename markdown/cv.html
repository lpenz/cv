            <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
            <p>I’m currently working as an embedded software architect
            of DmOS - DATACOM’s universal embedded OS. I focus on
            modularity, continuous integration, incremental
            qualification and DevOps. I work very closely with the
            DevOps team, bringing solutions and new technologies, and
            also helping in general.</p>
            <p>I was one of the architects that worked on the initial
            definitions of the architecture, processes and tools used
            nowadays in the company. The architecture group itself was
            something new back then.</p>
            <p>Before the creation of the architecture group, I led
            small (8) development teams. At first, I led teams of
            embedded software development for about 5 years, as I
            started as a developer myself. I then led the test
            infrastructure team for about a year while also acting as a
            software architect for the Ethernet switch product line.</p>
            <p>I hold a master degree in computer science from UFRGS. My
            research line was on computer networks, distributed systems,
            fault tolerance and security. My dissertation was about
            distributed firewall rule coherence. I implemented the
            prototype checker in Haskell.</p>
            <p>I hold an MBA on management and leadership from UNISINOS.
            I graduated in electrical engineering from UFRGS.</p>
            <p>I value technical excellence, out-of-the-box thinking,
            generalism, strategic planning and long-term
            maintainability. I’m always looking for vulnerabilities and
            enhancement opportunities in my knowledge and tool set.</p>
            <p>Out of the professional context, I have studied and
            obtained a license to fly sailplanes. I can definitely say
            that I learned a lot from doing that, from the differences
            with my area (extreme risk aversion) as well as from the
            similarities (briefing/debriefing ~ sprint
            planning/review).</p>
