aboutme: |
    I'm currently working as an embedded software architect of DmOS ---
    DATACOM's universal embedded OS. I focus on modularity, continuous
    integration, incremental qualification and DevOps. I work very closely with
    the DevOps team, bringing solutions and new technologies, and also helping
    in general.

    I was one of the architects that worked on the initial definitions of the
    architecture, processes and tools used nowadays in the company. The
    architecture group itself was something new back then.

    Before the creation of the architecture group, I led small (8) development
    teams. At first, I led teams of embedded software development for about 5
    years, as I started as a developer myself. I then led the test
    infrastructure team for about a year before becoming a software architect.

    I hold a master degree in computer science from UFRGS. My research line was
    on computer networks, distributed systems and fault tolerance. My
    dissertation was about distributed firewall rule coherence. I implemented
    the prototype checker in Haskell.

    I hold an MBA on management and leadership from UNISINOS. I graduated in
    electrical engineering, also from UFRGS.

    I value technical excellence, out-of-the-box thinking, generalism, strategic
    planning and long-term maintainability. I'm always looking for
    vulnerabilities and enhancement opportunities in my knowledge and tool set.

    Out of the professional context, I have studied and obtained a license to fly
    sailplanes. I can definitely say that I learned a lot from doing that, from the
    differences with my area (extreme risk aversion) as well as from the
    similarities (briefing/debriefing ~ sprint planning/review).

  - I installed my first Debian GNU/Linux at home in 2003, and never reinstalled it
    from scratch. I use the "testing" release, and update it constantly.
  - I learned Haskell while developing the prototype of my MSc dissertation in 2006.
    Since then, I have used it on side projects and on programming contests when I
    have the chance.
  - Even though I did not take computer science at graduation, I was 6th on the
    entry exam of the MSc at my University (UFRGS).
  - I once got all questions right in a logical reasoning test. The psychologist
    that evaluated it said that she had never seen that before.
  - This CV is maintained at <http://github.com/lpenz/cv> with configuration
    management, automated tests and continuous deployment
