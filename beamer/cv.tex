\section{About me}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{About me}
    I'm currently working as an embedded software architect of DmOS ---
DATACOM's universal embedded OS. I focus on modularity, continuous
integration, incremental qualification and DevOps. I work very closely
with the DevOps team, bringing solutions and new technologies, and also
helping in general.

\vspace{0.3cm}I was one of the architects that worked on the initial definitions of
the architecture, processes and tools used nowadays in the company. The
architecture group itself was something new back then.

\vspace{0.3cm}Before the creation of the architecture group, I led small (8)
development teams. At first, I led teams of embedded software
development for about 5 years, as I started as a developer myself. I
then led the test infrastructure team for about a year while also acting
as a software architect for the Ethernet switch product line.

\vspace{0.3cm}I hold a master degree in computer science from UFRGS. My research line
was on computer networks, distributed systems, fault tolerance and
security. My dissertation was about distributed firewall rule coherence.
I implemented the prototype checker in Haskell.

\vspace{0.3cm}I hold an MBA on management and leadership from UNISINOS. I graduated in
electrical engineering from UFRGS.

\vspace{0.3cm}I value technical excellence, out-of-the-box thinking, generalism,
strategic planning and long-term maintainability. I'm always looking for
vulnerabilities and enhancement opportunities in my knowledge and tool
set.

\vspace{0.3cm}Out of the professional context, I have studied and obtained a license
to fly sailplanes. I can definitely say that I learned a lot from doing
that, from the differences with my area (extreme risk aversion) as well
as from the similarities (briefing/debriefing \(\sim\) sprint
planning/review).

\section{Misc}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Random anecdotes}
    \begin{itemize}
        
        \item I installed my first Debian GNU/Linux at home in 2003, and never
reinstalled it from scratch. I use the ``testing'' release, and update
it constantly.

        
        \item I learned Haskell while developing the prototype of my MSc dissertation
in 2006. Since then, I have used it on side projects and on programming
contests when I have the chance.

        
        \item Even though I did not take computer science at graduation, I was 6th on
the entry exam of the MSc at my University (UFRGS).

        
        \item I once got all questions right in a logical reasoning test. The
psychologist that evaluated it said that she had never seen that before.

        
        \item This CV is maintained at \url{http://github.com/lpenz/cv} with
configuration management, automated tests and continuous deployment to
\url{http://cv.lpenz.org} in several output formats.
